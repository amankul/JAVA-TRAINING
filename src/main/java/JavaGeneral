Main is always public static void.

Methods declared public in a superclass also must be public in all subclasses. Methods declared protected in a superclass must either be protected or public in subclasses; they cannot be private.
Private methods are not inherited.

Abstract class cannot be instantiated too. Also abstract methods need to go in abstract class. Their implementation will be provided by child classes.

Final variable cannot be reassigned. Final method cannot be overridden. Final class cannot be extended.

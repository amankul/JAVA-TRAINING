/*

In Java there are four types of references differentiated on the way by which they are garbage collected.

    Strong References - when objects instantiated
    Weak References - shd be explicitly specified
    Soft References -  shd be explicitly specified, object not collected until JVM runs out of mem.
    Phantom References - The objects which are being referenced by phantom references are eligible for garbage collection. But, before removing them from the memory,
    JVM puts them in a queue called ‘reference queue’ . They are put in a reference queue after calling finalize() method on them
